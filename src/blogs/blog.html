                                Eating Too Much Salt Could Cause Stress Levels to Rise
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                        THERE’S A REASON why your Christmas dinner tastes so good—the turkey, gravy, potatoes, and trimmings make up one of the saltiest meals you’re likely to consume all year. Add to that the crisps, cheeses, and other snacks that we like to tuck into over the holiday period, and our salt levels across the festive season can end up far beyond what’s needed or recommended.
                        The physical effects of this are well known. As salt levels rise, so does blood pressure, which can increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke. But scientists think that salt could also have another influence: on behavior. 
                        In particular, they’re beginning to unpick how it’s linked to stress.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The topic has, until recently, been underexplored, as the impact of salt is a difficult subject to examine in humans.
                         Monitoring people’s salt intake, even under controlled conditions, is hard because of how ubiquitous it is in our food. Plus, since salt can increase blood pressure acutely and over time, knowingly adding salt to the diet of study participants poses an ethical problem. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        So researchers at the University of Edinburgh have been running experiments with the next best thing: mice. They’re very similar to humans in terms of anatomy, physiology, and genetics—and how both species respond to stress is governed by factors that can include diet, explains Matthew Bailey, a professor of renal physiology at the university. 
                        Mice also typically don’t eat a lot of salt, which makes testing its impact on them easier.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        To investigate the link between salt intake and stress, Bailey and his colleagues fed male mice—some for two weeks, some for up to eight weeks—a high-salt diet, containing a proportion of salt similar to the typical intake of humans. 
                        When the researchers then analyzed blood samples from the mice, they found that levels of the stress hormone cortisol were always higher in those on the high-salt diet compared to mice in the control group consuming low levels of salt—both when they were in a resting state and after being restrained in a Plexiglas tube to induce stress.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The stress response wasn’t turned on and off by adding salt to the mice’s diet, but amplified, Bailey explains. “It’s like a dimmer switch in a light,” he says. “The stress system was kind of turned on a little bit more.”

                                Tech’s new year resolution
                                
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                                o, that was 2022. After two years of plague, we’ve now added poverty and war. Feeling optimistic about 2023, anyone? Enjoy those Christmas parties while you can…
                        </p>
                        <P>
                                It feels somewhat churlish – amid a cost of living crisis, looming environmental catastrophe, rampant inflation, the public sector falling apart, 
                                incompetent government, and England getting knocked out of the World Cup – for anyone in the tech sector to nervously raise a hand and say,
                                “What about us?” But equally, it is true to say that the tech sector closes the year in a gloomier mood than it has for a long time.
                        </P>
                        <p>
                        Let’s say the unsayable: the pandemic was good for tech. Sales boomed. E-commerce grew. Digital communication became essential. 
                        Just imagine, if lockdown had happened 20 years ago – even just 10 years ago, when home broadband was mostly slow and often a luxury. 
                        The disaster of the pandemic would have been exponentially worse. As a result, tech companies entered 2022 on a high. Let the good times roll!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        We end the year cowering somewhat, under the shadow of our own ambition, over-optimism and hubris.
                         Tens of thousands of jobs lost around the world. Share prices plummeting. Belts being tightened and budgets cut. 
                         Elon Musk making everyone think the tech sector must be full of idiots. 
                         Want a new smartphone for Christmas? Nah – not giving my hard-earned cash to those fools on the hill.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The mood is gloomy – many in tech expect the first half of next year to be very difficult, hanging on to the hope that by the summer, things will be looking up.
                         We’ll see. But perhaps bursting a few bubbles is not such a bad thing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The sector needs to lose the mentality of tech for tech’s sake. Tech is, and always has been, nothing more than an enabler. It’s enabled some amazing things,
                        for sure – changed lives and workplaces for the better. But nurses are on strike, leaving the profession in droves because they can’t make ends meet.
                        Childhood poverty is on the rise. People choosing between heating and eating. None of this is tech’s fault – but tech is not enabling the sort of social utopia that some of its loudest cheerleaders would like you to believe. 
                        The real world is not Silicon Valley.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        For 2023, let the tech sector’s new year resolution be a little more humility. Let’s return to what makes technology great – making ordinary people’s lives better. 
                        To all tech leaders, use this time of slowdown to reflect on what matters. The opportunities of the digital revolution will continue – let’s focus on making them work for the good of all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
