1
00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.840
the second is to look things in the face

2
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.600
think of what a privilege it is to be

3
00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:08.079
he suffers more than necessary who

4
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.880
be like the cliff against which the

5
00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:21.280
but it stands firm and tames the fury of

6
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.000
nature hath given men one tongue but two

7
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.840
that we may hear from others twice as

8
00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:40.798
people are frugal in guarding their

9
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.359
personal property but as soon as it

10
00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.240
comes to squandering time they are most

11
00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:50.399
in which it is right to be stingy

12
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.359
begin it wants to live and count each

13
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.359
separate day as a separate life

14
00:02:01.118 --> 00:02:05.200
if you really want to escape the things

15
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.039
what you're needing is not to be in a

16
00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:20.878
until we have begun to go without them

17
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.879
we fail to realize how unnecessary many

18
00:02:22.878 --> 00:02:26.959
we've been using them not because we

19
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.599
if a man knows not which port he sails

20
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.120
we all love ourselves more than other

21
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.400
but care more about their opinion than

22
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.920
is a rule to remember in future

23
00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:01.199
when anything tempts you to feel bitter

24
00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:06.079
this is misfortune but to bear this

25
00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.680
man conquers the world by conquering

26
00:03:18.318 --> 00:03:23.280
waste no more time arguing what a good

27
00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:33.639
the things you think about determine the

28
00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.798
but how you react to it that matters

29
00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:59.759
everything we hear is an opinion not a

30
00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:06.079
everything we see is a perspective

31
00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:14.359
luck is what happens when preparation

32
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.918
it is not the man who has too little

33
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.919
but the man who craves more that is poor

34
00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.400
knowing yourself is the beginning of all

35
00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:58.560
the more we value things outside our

36
00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:13.599
change a person's worth is measured by

37
00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:26.240
be content to be thought foolish and

38
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:38.120
is frequently more hurtful to us than

39
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.280
and the injury itself disappears

40
00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:13.758
what we do now echoes in eternity

41
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.879
the one who puts the finishing touches

42
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.160
it's time you realize that you have

43
00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:37.758
something in you more powerful and

44
00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:44.240
than the things that affect you

45
00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:44.240
and make you dance like a puppet

46
00:06:45.918 --> 00:06:50.478
wealth consists not in having great

47
00:06:55.918 --> 00:07:00.879
be silent for the most part or

48
00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:05.918
say only what is necessary in a few

49
00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:12.159
all cruelty springs from weakness

50
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.680
it is a rough road that leads to the

51
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.639
as though it were the very last act of

52
00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:36.400
whatever can happen at any time

53
00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:50.638
because a thing seems difficult for you

54
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.280
do not think it impossible for anyone to

55
00:07:54.959 --> 00:08:00.079
freedom is secured not by the fulfilling

56
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:13.800
circumstances don't make the man

57
00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:13.799
they only reveal him to himself

58
00:08:15.038 --> 00:08:20.878
it is not death that a man should fear

59
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.120
but he should fear never beginning to

60
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.520
the key is to keep company only with

61
00:08:36.158 --> 00:08:40.399
humans have come into being for the sake

62
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.959
it can ruin your life only if it ruins

63
00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:07.319
the happiness of your life depends upon

64
00:09:08.639 --> 00:09:13.519
mastery of reading and writing requires

65
00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:25.119
life is very short and anxious for those

66
00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:28.480
who forget the past neglect the present

67
00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:43.919
use them to throw open the windows of

68
00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:02.920
is to be unlike him who performed the

69
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:09.519
sometimes even to live is an act of

70
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:19.079
it's not that we have little time

71
00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:19.079
but more that we waste a good deal of it

72
00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:24.320
whatever happens at all happens as it

73
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.159
our life is what our thoughts make it

74
00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:42.320
how much more grievous are the

75
00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:54.479
will never do anything worthy of a man

76
00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:03.600
everything else is either past or is

77
00:11:05.278 --> 00:11:09.039
progress is not achieved by luck or

78
00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:14.039
but by working on yourself daily

79
00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:19.759
in banquets remember that you entertain

80
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.839
and whatever you shall have given to the

81
00:11:26.839 --> 00:11:31.600
eject but what you shall have given to

82
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.720
no person has the power to have

83
00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:45.919
it is in their power not to want what

84
00:11:45.919 --> 00:11:51.599
and to cheerfully put to good use

85
00:11:53.278 --> 00:11:57.200
if what you have seems insufficient to

86
00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:04.320
then though you possess the world

87
00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:20.078
difficulties strengthen the mind

88
00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:30.799
not how long it is but how good it is is

89
00:12:32.559 --> 00:12:37.799
life if well lived is long enough

90
00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:43.600
the best answer to anger is silence

91
00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:51.078
as it did on eating and drinking

92
00:12:52.159 --> 00:12:56.958
nowhere can man find a quieter or more

93
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.839
was either stronger or weaker than thee

94
00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:25.839
the impediment to action advances action

95
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.839
what stands in the way becomes the way

96
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:33.639
to wish to be well is a part of becoming

97
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:49.120
no great thing is created suddenly

98
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:51.919
any more than a bunch of grapes or fig

99
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:55.198
if you tell me that you desire a fig i

100
00:14:03.278 --> 00:14:09.039
we suffer more often in imagination than

101
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:21.120
the next inquiry being how he may best

102
00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:21.120
live the time that he has to live

103
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:29.959
the whole future lies in uncertainty

104
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:37.199
every new beginning comes from some

105
00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:43.679
but life is very short and anxious for

106
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.600
we suffer not from the events in our

107
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.360
but from our judgment about them

108
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:06.320
it is our attitude toward events not

109
00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:10.078
events themselves which we can control

110
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:13.120
nothing is by its own nature calamitous

111
00:15:10.078 --> 00:15:15.278
even death is terrible only if we fear

112
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.720
attach yourself to what is spiritually

113
00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:36.720
superior regardless of what other people

114
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:43.120
hold to your true aspirations no matter

115
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.800
confine yourself to the present

116
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.839
no man is free who is not a master of

117
00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.440
very little is needed to make a happy

118
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:07.240
it is all within yourself in your way of

119
00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:13.120
if you live in harmony with nature

120
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.000
if you live according to what others

121
00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:26.159
learn to be indifferent to what makes no

122
00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:34.000
the greatest blessings of mankind are

123
00:16:30.639 --> 00:16:37.198
within us and within our reach

124
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.278
a wise man is content with his lot

125
00:16:39.278 --> 00:16:43.600
without wishing for what he has not

126
00:16:45.278 --> 00:16:51.198
man is not worried by real problems

127
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.559
so much as by his imagined anxieties

128
00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:02.639
small-minded people blame others

129
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:07.679
average people blame themselves

130
00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:07.679
the wise see all blame as foolishness

131
00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:14.400
respect the past be open to the future

132
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.400
the life we receive is not short but we

133
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:26.880
we are not ill provided but use what we

134
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:36.440
regardless of what life throws at you
