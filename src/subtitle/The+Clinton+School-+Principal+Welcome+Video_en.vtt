00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.798
welcome to the clinton school we are six

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.798
through 12. we have been thinking a lot

3
00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.638
about how we support students over that

4
00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.320
course of seven years so not every

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.080
middle school and the upper grades

6
00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:15.839
program but really having that ability

7
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.839
to support students and then think

8
00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.519
critically about how we support students

9
00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:21.359
over a seven year span when they're

10
00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.198
coming in as 11 year olds and leaving us

11
00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.199
18 year olds is something that feels

12
00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.279
really special in a new york city public

13
00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.240
school over that time we've been able to

14
00:00:27.278 --> 00:00:31.278
hire and attract staff that have two

15
00:00:31.278 --> 00:00:35.200
attributes they're kind and they're

16
00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:37.839
competent so not everybody wants to work

17
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.600
we've been we've had a lot of success in

18
00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:43.119
attracting a staff and building a

19
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.200
culture where people do and that's

20
00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:46.959
something that's been super important to

21
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.879
our growth three thinking a little bit

22
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.120
just about this beautiful building and

23
00:00:48.878 --> 00:00:53.599
our location so we're a eight story

24
00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:56.399
building located off between fifth

25
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.719
avenue and union square full of modern

26
00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.799
wi-fi technology there's tremendous

27
00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.878
we even have working elevators and

28
00:01:02.878 --> 00:01:07.118
lockers which are rare for a public

29
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.560
school in new york city and then fourth

30
00:01:07.118 --> 00:01:10.799
we're an international baccalaureate

31
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.519
world school and so we offer the ib

32
00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.520
program to all 11th and 12th graders so

33
00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:17.759
there's no application process we don't

34
00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:19.679
track in any way students who come in

35
00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.439
complete the regents by the end of 10th

36
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.759
and then they move on to ib courses in

37
00:01:21.438 --> 00:01:25.919
11th and 12th so not every single

38
00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.840
student is going to go for an ib diploma

39
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.359
it's a new york public school so every

40
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.920
student will graduate with the regents

41
00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:34.078
diploma but i think having a model that

42
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.799
really supports a range of learners in

43
00:01:34.078 --> 00:01:38.639
the ib is something that's been super

44
00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.720
beneficial to students across the

45
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.159
spectrum at clinton really reflecting

46
00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:45.158
the diversity of new york city
